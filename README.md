# Medical Waitlist
Waiting in line can be a frustrating experience. It can be even more frustrating
when youâ€™re sick. Patients across Canada often face long wait times to see
medical professionals. Walk-in clinics, especially those in population dense
areas, can have wait times that prevent patients from seeing a doctor for hours.
Thus, our project idea is a system specifically for targeting the problem of
walk-in clinic waitlist times and overall waitlist efficiency.
