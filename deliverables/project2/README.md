# P2: Ideation and Lo-fi Prototypes
There are three major components of the medical-waitlist:
- Mobile Client (for patients)
- Office Display Client (in the clinic itself)
- Receptionist Client (for the receptionist)

All these components have their own associated Balsamiq interactive PDFs as the
Lo-fi prototypes. These PDFs have "Official" and "Alternative" versions. The
Alternative versions represent all ideation that took place before we chose the
official versions. Note that the PDFs are interactive so ensure that you
download the PDFs locally to take advantage of this.
