# Heuristics Analysis for Walkin Clinic Waitlist Application 
Our application has three components. The first is a clinic client that shows
the waitlist on a screen within the clinic. The second is a mobile application
for patient use. The third is a receptionist client on a desktop that manages
information available to both the clinic and mobile clients. In this document,
we will outline key points with regards to heuristically evaluating our system.

## 1. Visibility of system status 
The status of the system is clear for each of the three components. The clinic
client clearly shows which patient’s turn it is and which is up next. Wait times
are also clear and visible. Both the mobile and receptionist applications also
help the user orient themselves. For example the mobile application clearly
shows which section of the application the user is in (sign up, find a clinic,
etc). The receptionist client also shows what section you are currently
referencing based on highlighted tab.

## 2. Match between system and the real world 
Icons such as a gear and tool icon for settings or a bell icon for notifications
are used to help the user relate functionality of the application with the
applicable items. For the receptionist client features such as themes in the
settings menu actually show a color preview. In the mobile application the real
pictures of the clinics are shown further connecting the application to the real
world. 

## 3. User control and freedom 
For the receptionist client the user can add new patients manually, delete
patients, move patients around on the waitlist (not implemented), edit patient
information (not implemented), and change various settings associated with
themes, and text. On the mobile application the user can easily move between
states and edit things such as their favorites lists. The applications do not
allow full control such as importing your own themes or changing the layout
since we believe the tradeoffs i.e. losing a recognizable interface is not worth
the perceived benefits of giving the users more control. 

## 4. Consistency and standards
The mobile application uses standard Android iconography for things such as
settings, and search functions. The theme for the mobile application is unified
and each no item has a double meaning. The same can be said for the receptionist
application with the exception being adhering to a desktop experience instead of
a mobile/touchscreen experience.

## 5. Error prevention 
Error prevention is fleshed out in the mobile application. When signing up for a
new account the application does not allow the user to continue without filling
out the required information. Also the design of both the mobile and desktop
applications are simple, streamlined, and there is appropriate spacing between
buttons reducing accidental clicks. 

## 6. Recognition rather than recall 
There are multiple parts of the different systems that allow users to quickly
recognize and access the information or settings that they need. On the mobile
application the pictures of clinics are added so a user can quickly recognize a
clinic they are familiar with. There is also a favorites list, recent clinics,
and “my appointment” for the mobile application. These elements allow the user
to access the relevant information without remembering things like what the last
the last clinic they visited was. 

## 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
The mobile application has a lot of functionality. Always visible menus allows
users to quickly find different information such as which doctors are on, clinic
information, and/or appointment information. Users can navigate back and forward
between pages for optimal efficiency. The receptionist client has a more
simplified layout but again the interface was designed to making getting to
where the user wants to go as simple as possible. 

## 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design 
All all features are simple, and easy to access. With exception of the news
ticker on the clinic display all the information in the application is relevant.
This feature expands user functionality at the expense of relevance but can be
removed or customized. Both applications utilize the space well without being
cluttered. 

## 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors 
In the signup phase for the mobile application if the user doesn’t enter the
required information a message will tell them the specific information they are
missing so that they can fill it out correctly. 

## 10. Help and documentation 
Help documentation is included within the system, however, most of this is
aggregated within one section in each component. It might be more helpful to
users if more documentation was spread out throughout the application as
necessary instead of having to refer to the entire documentation.
