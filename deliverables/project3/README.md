# P3: Hi-Fi Prototypes and Heuristic Evaluation
For our hi-fi prototype, we decided to use Axure as our prototyping tool. Recall
that our system has three components: Office Display Client, Smartphone App, and
Receptionist Desktop Client. Here are links to the Axure prototypes for each
component:
- [Office Display Client](https://hxqcz0.axshare.com)
- [Smartphone App](https://yn0drl.axshare.com)
- [Receptionist Desktop Client](https://dcjdkz.axshare.com)

[Here](HeuristicEvaluation.md) is our Heuristic Evaluation of our system.
